# 📊 Economic Crisis Analysis (2008 vs. COVID-19)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates the impact of two major economic crises:  
1️⃣ **The 2008 Global Financial Crisis**  
2️⃣ **The COVID-19 Pandemic (2019-2022)**   

By analyzing key financial indicators (**GDP, Inflation, Unemployment, Banking Performance**), I evaluate how financial policies influenced economic recovery.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- The COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharper but shorter spike in unemployment compared to the 2008 crisis.  
- Inflation remained relatively stable after 2008 but showed significant volatility during the COVID-19 period.  
- Banking sector recovery was faster post-COVID-19 due to swift policy interventions.  
- Fiscal stimulus during COVID-19 led to quicker GDP rebound compared to the 2008 crisis.  
- Media commentary aligned well with quantitative data trends, reinforcing the analysis context.
