# Economic Crisis Analysis (2008 – now)

## Project Overview  
This project investigates the impact of the **2008 Global Financial Crisis** on key economic indicators: GDP, Unemployment, Inflation, and Banking Performance. By analyzing how economic policy influenced recovery, I compare market behavior then and now.

- GDP dropped significantly during the crisis but slowly rebounded with policy support.
- Banking reforms after 2008 improved financial stability in later years.
- Media commentary confirms trends visible in the quantitative data.
