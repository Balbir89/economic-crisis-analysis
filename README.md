## Overview  
This project examines the impact of the **2008 Global Financial Crisis** on key economic indicators: GDP, Unemployment, Inflation, and Banking performance. It assesses policy responses and compares economic trends from then to now.

---

## My Role  
- Collected, cleaned, and integrated datasets from BLS and FRED  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Utilized SQL and Excel for data querying and validation  
- Developed clear visualizations to communicate insights effectively  
- Documented methodology and made the analysis reproducible with Jupyter Notebooks  

---

## Key Insights  
- Sharp rise in unemployment during 2008–09, followed by gradual recovery  
- Significant GDP decline with slow rebound driven by policy measures  
- Post-crisis banking reforms increased financial stability  
- Media narratives aligned with quantitative trends  

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- SQL for data extraction and manipulation  
- Excel for cleaning and preliminary analysis  
- Jupyter & Google Colab for interactive notebooks  
- Git & GitHub for version control
